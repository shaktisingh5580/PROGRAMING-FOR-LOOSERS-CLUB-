<h1>Programming for Losers (PFL) 👩‍💻👨‍💻</h1>

<p><strong>Programming for Losers (PFL)</strong> is a grassroots initiative started by a group of passionate first-year students. We're just a bunch of coding enthusiasts trying to create a supportive community outside of our formal college environment. Our goal? To connect with like-minded individuals who share our love for programming and technology.</p>

<p>Whether you're a coding newbie or a budding tech wizard, PFL is the place where we all start as 'losers' but grow together into winners. 💪</p>

<h2>🎯 Our Mission</h2>

<p>As an independent club, we're not affiliated with any college or institution. We're simply students helping students, learning together, and building a network that extends beyond our campus. At PFL, we believe in the power of <strong>peer learning</strong>. We're all students here, learning and growing together. We share our experiences, help each other overcome coding challenges, and collaborate on projects.</p>

<p>It’s not about one person teaching another; it’s about <strong>collective growth and mutual support</strong>.</p>
